# Malicious-html-page-
POC of  using html and scripts to make a malicious webpage to demonstrate website based attacks.
This simple site is to demonstrate ways hackers can use scripts to code a malicious webpage to exploit any one who visits the site.
This site currently will:
1. redirect users to target website after a set time.
2. a link on it will download a file (could be malware) when they click the link.
3. the leave page button will also download a file when clicked.
4. iframes are used to send some traffic to the targeted site.
In order to get users to a malicious site like this all you need to do is host your evil site and get people to click your url or link.
This is only for learning and demo purposes.
I created the site in the target variables, however i dont host it, hence i didnt add more dos iframes. 
Change the variables urls ect to point it towards your lab.Do not use to attack sites you dont own and host and dont send malicious sites 
people.
